AI provides a neat solution for this: we ask AI to read the ticket, and score it in terms of clarity. Unless the score is high enough, it will keep on asking questions. Once the score is high, it will write the task outline in the outline.md file. If curious, you can read <code>memory-bank/prompts/p-issue-clarify.md</code> to see the prompt.</p> <p>And this is how we would prompt the AI:</p> <pre><code>instructions: @p-issue-clarify.md\ntask: @123-ticket.md\nOnce the task is clear, write the outline here: @123-outline.md\n</code></pre> <p>Thinking model</p> <p>Note that I keep on using <code>123</code> as an example issue number, because it looks better than writing <code>[issue_number]-ticket.md</code> everywhere. For each issue, the number will obviously be different. The reason I prepend the issue number to the filenames should be pretty obvious now: it makes it trivial to find them.</p> <p>With these instructions, the AI will:</p> <ol> <li>Read the ticket</li> <li>Give it a clarity score from 0 to 100</li> <li>If the score is below 95, it will ask questions to improve the score</li> <li>Once the score is high enough, it will provide the task outline, with a very clear task</li> </ol> <p>Note: Cursor has multiple agent modes: Agent, Ask, etc. In Agent mode, I have found that, no matter how strongly I ask the AI to not make code changes, sometimes it stubbornly tries to one-shot everything.

In this mode, the AI is not allowed to edit the codebase.</p> <p>AI should write the ticket outline to the outline.md file created in the previous step.

However, if you are working in a team, I would highly suggest you don't:</p> <ul> <li>Other team members might not want to be bothered with the memory-bank, or feel coerced to use a specific coding workflow, or might want to use a completely different memory-bank content.</li> <li>If multiple devs are modifying the same files in the memory-bank, solving those merge conflicts would be a miserable waste of time.</li> </ul> <p>Obviously, keep in mind that by having the memory-bank only locally, if you delete the repo, you will lose it.</p> <p>Q: Should I always use a thinking model? Isn't that expensive?</p> <p>A: In my experience and levels of usage, LLM thinking models are cheap enough to not have to bother with cost. In theory, you could balance cost, speed and quality, using inference models (i.e. not-thinking) for fast, simple, single-step tasks, and thinking models for slower, more complex multi-step tasks. In practice, I don't bother with that and default to whatever thinking model is cheap and giving me good results (right now <code>gemini-2.5-pro</code>).</p>"}]}
